# PythonAnywhere Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses the specific issues you're encountering with your PythonAnywhere deployment.

## Issue 1: Dependency Conflict

You're seeing this error:
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
arviz 0.11.4 requires typing-extensions<4,>=3.7.4.3, but you have typing-extensions 4.12.2 which is incompatible.
```

### Solution:

This is a warning rather than an error. It's indicating that there's a conflict between the version of `typing-extensions` that's installed and the version that `arviz` requires. However, this shouldn't prevent your Flask app from running.

If you want to resolve this conflict, you can try:

```bash
pip3 install --user typing-extensions==3.10.0
```

This will downgrade the `typing-extensions` package to a version that's compatible with `arviz`.

## Issue 2: "Not Found" Error

You're seeing a "Not Found" error when trying to access your web app.

### Solution:

This could be due to several reasons:

1. **The WSGI file is not configured correctly**:
   
   Make sure your WSGI file (`/var/www/juggleagent_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`) is correctly configured to point to your Flask app. Here's a simplified version that should work:

   ```python
   import sys
   import os
   
   # Add your project directory to the sys.path
   path = '/home/JuggleAgent/SalesAgentJoline'
   if path not in sys.path:
       sys.path.append(path)
   
   # Import the test Flask app
   from test_flask_app import app as application
   ```

2. **The project files are not in the correct location**:
   
   Make sure your project files are in the correct location. Run these commands in a Bash console:

   ```bash
   cd
   ls -la SalesAgentJoline
   ls -la SalesAgentJoline/test_flask_app.py
   ```

   If the files don't exist, you need to clone the repository again:

   ```bash
   cd
   rm -rf SalesAgentJoline
   git clone https://github.com/JugglerAgent/SalesAgentJoline.git
   ```

3. **The Flask app is not properly configured**:
   
   Create a very simple Flask app to test if the basic setup works:

   ```bash
   cd
   mkdir -p test_flask
   cd test_flask
   
   cat > app.py << 'EOL'
   from flask import Flask
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       return "Hello from Flask! This is a test app."
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   EOL
   ```

   Then update your WSGI file to use this test app:

   ```bash
   cat > /var/www/juggleagent_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py << 'EOL'
   import sys
   import os
   
   # Add your project directory to the sys.path
   path = '/home/JuggleAgent/test_flask'
   if path not in sys.path:
       sys.path.append(path)
   
   # Import the test Flask app
   from app import app as application
   EOL
   ```

   Reload your web app and visit your site: https://juggleagent.pythonanywhere.com/

4. **Check the error logs**:
   
   Go to the Web tab and check the error logs:
   - `juggleagent.pythonanywhere.com.error.log`
   - `juggleagent.pythonanywhere.com.server.log`

   These logs will provide more information about what's causing the error.

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

1. **Check if the project files exist**:
   
   ```bash
   cd
   ls -la SalesAgentJoline
   ls -la SalesAgentJoline/test_flask_app.py
   ```

2. **If the files don't exist, clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   cd
   rm -rf SalesAgentJoline
   git clone https://github.com/JugglerAgent/SalesAgentJoline.git
   ```

3. **Create a simple test Flask app**:
   
   ```bash
   cd
   mkdir -p test_flask
   cd test_flask
   
   cat > app.py << 'EOL'
   from flask import Flask
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       return "Hello from Flask! This is a test app."
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   EOL
   ```

4. **Update the WSGI file to use the test app**:
   
   ```bash
   cat > /var/www/juggleagent_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py << 'EOL'
   import sys
   import os
   
   # Add your project directory to the sys.path
   path = '/home/JuggleAgent/test_flask'
   if path not in sys.path:
       sys.path.append(path)
   
   # Import the test Flask app
   from app import app as application
   EOL
   ```

5. **Install Flask**:
   
   ```bash
   pip3 install --user flask
   ```

6. **Reload the web app**:
   
   Go to the Web tab and click the "Reload" button.

7. **Visit your site**:
   
   https://juggleagent.pythonanywhere.com/

If you still encounter issues, please check the error logs and provide the error messages for further troubleshooting.
